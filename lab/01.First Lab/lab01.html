<h2>Welcome to the first lab</h2>

<p>
  The file you are currently reading is
  <code>./lab/01.First Lab/lab01.html</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The calendar system (by default) will use the <code>index.html</code>
  file within the specific class directory as the page that it shows the user.
  This file could be easily sym-linked to a different file, via the command line,
  in this case the following command was run to link lab01.html to index.html:
  <pre><code class="text">ln -s lab01.html index.html</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  For simplicity you could just make the lecture/lab file <code>index.html</code>
  within the directory.
</p>

<h4>LaTex and Formulas</h4>
<p>
  The <b>MathJax</b> library is included within the calendar, and will allow you
  to embed formulas, example:
  $$
  P^i_t = P_0 + V^i_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
  $$
  We can also do formulas inline with the text like \( a = 47 t \),
  just note how we surround the two examples.
</p>

<h4>Embedding Source Code</h4>
<p>
  If you want to show users code, the <b>hightlight.js</b> library is included.
  All you need to do is place the source-code between a
  <b>&lt;pre&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> tags.  The library will
  attempt to guess the language that you are using, although this
  can be overriden (see example in the source to this page).
</p>
<pre><code class="python"><codeinject src="example.py"></code></pre>

<h4>Calendar Features</h4>

<p>
  For the purposes of examples, and how to use some of the features of the
  calendar system:
</p>

<p>
  A few values are automatically populated for you, unless explicitly defined in $PAGE_MODIFY, these
  include:

    <li>
      <b>type</b> - What type of class we are currently in (example class, project, lab, exam...)
      - <b><replace value="type"></b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>ctype</b> - Same as <b>type</b>, except the first character is <b><u>C</u></b>apitalized.
      - <b><replace value="ctype"></b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>event</b> - What the number of this class/lab/etc is.
      - <b><replace value="event"></b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>zevent</b> - What the number of this class/lab/etc is (2 digits zero filled).
      - <b><replace value="zevent"></b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>title</b> - The title of this specific class/lab/etc.
      - <b><replace value="title"></b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>course</b> - The defined course number, example: IT350.
      - <b><replace value="course"></b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>coursename</b> - The long title of the course, example: Web and Internet Programming
      - <b><replace value="coursename"></b>
