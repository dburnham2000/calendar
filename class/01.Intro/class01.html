  Who is your instructor, the role of the website, course policies, and a brief intro into the topic.
</p>

<h4>Readings</h4>
<p>
  All suggested readings have already been posted to the calendar for the semester,
  primarily from the 13th edition of xxxxxxxxx, Prentice Hall 2014, as well as
  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, Fourth Edition, by J Doe and L Thomson 2009.
  While these books are marked as <b>recommended</b> you are strongly encouraged to follow the readings
  throughout this course.  The online notes serve as a distilled source of information, but the texts will
  dive much deeper into a subject and may help if you are to get lost or find yourself behind.
