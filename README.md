# Calendar version 4
Cal4 is a PHP Based Calendar System for Course Management that allows an instructor to post course material in a simple and automated fashion.

# How to clone
Since the system uses other git repos as submodules, you will want to clone via:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jskenney/calendar.git
```
